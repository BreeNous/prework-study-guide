          <li>The head element: contains information about the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS: is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: is used to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage using the style element in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet: allows one to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file that is linked to the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Seperation of concerns: is a term that means to separate code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>A Selector: in a CSS rule defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations: in a CSS rule contain the property we want to apply and and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A Margin: property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes: allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Two selectors can be affected by one rule by using a comma to seperate the two selectors.</li>
          <li>The * symbol used as a selector, applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>A period preceding a selector will designate it to be a class selector and any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
