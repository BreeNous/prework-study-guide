        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element: contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element: represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS: is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: is used to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage using the style element in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet: allows one to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file that is linked to the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Seperation of concerns: is a term that means to separate code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>A Selector: in a CSS rule defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations: in a CSS rule contain the property we want to apply and and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A Margin: property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes: allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Two selectors can be affected by one rule by using a comma to seperate the two selectors.</li>
          <li>The * symbol used as a selector, applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>A period preceding a selector will designate it to be a class selector and any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout: used to switch to different branches when followed by which branch you wish to change to.</li>
          <li>git pull origin: Pulls the remote branch into the local branch by running this command followed by which branch you wish to pull from.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and also switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages changes made from local branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m “message”: commit message that describes the changes we have made.</li>
          <li>git push origin: pushes up your changes from local to the remote repository when command is followed by the branch desired to be pushed.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript: a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>API: Application Programming Interface.</li>
          <li>Variables: are containers that store values. Start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
          <li>An operator: is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Conditionals: are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions: are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
          <li>Arguments: bits of data that functions need to do their job.</li>
          <li>Events: real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
          <li>const: keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
          <li>=: assignment operator symbol assigns specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Control flow: is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>if: when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
