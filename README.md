# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description 

This webpage is a tool for organizing my notes on some of the code basics that i've learned throughout the bootcamp prework. It serves as an example to what i've learned, because through it i learned some HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project is intended to be a final product to submit for the prework assignment.

## Usage

To use this website, all notes will be catagorized based on what they apply to. If there are key terms regarding HTML, then those should go in the HTML section and so fourth, other information for the rest of the catagories. Upon opening the DevTools console (right-click, inspect, then navigate to where it says "console"), you can see that JavaScript is functionally running. Each time you refresh the page you can be given a new topic to study, located underneath "Which topic should we study first?".
